# Advanced-Computer-Vision

SO this is a series of projects based on COMPUTER VISION
The sequence of projects is:

* Finger Counter
* Volume Gesture Control
* AI Mouse
* AI Virtual Painter

These projects were done with the help of modules I created in this repo:

https://github.com/Prayag-Chawla/Computer-Vision-Modules

All these projects involve high-end use of OpenCv.
It just displays how interesting dn exciting computer vision domain is. I have uploaded all the output videos in the mp4 format, which will give you an idea of how exactly the projects work.

Here is a photo output of volume gesture control project.
